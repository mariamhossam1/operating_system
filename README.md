In this project, I built a simulation of an operating system. The main focus of the project was building a correct architecture that simulates a real operating system.

There are 3 program files provided which are in .txt format, and I created an interpreter to read the .txt files and execute the code in them. I also implemented mutexes to ensure mutual exclusion over the critical resources. I have also implemented a scheduler that schedules the processes that are on the system.

I have implemented five system calls: Reading the data of any file on the device, Writing a text output to any file on the device, Printing data on the screen, Taking text input from user, Reading data from memory and Writing data to memory.
